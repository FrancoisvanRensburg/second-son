<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

<p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
    {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
    {skills.map(skill => (
        <li class="skill">{skill.name}</li>
    ))}
</ul>
{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

{goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
